But without structured guidance it tends to:\n\n- Use inconsistent commit formats across a session\n- Skip target branch confirmation and create PRs against the wrong branch\n- Not search for task documentation or validate task completion before opening a PR\n- Suggest labels that don't exist in the project\n- Process review comments in random order instead of by severity\n- Use the wrong GitHub API syntax for replying to threads (`-f` instead of `--input -`)\n- Generate verbose merge messages that clutter the git log\n- Merge without verifying all review comments have been addressed\n\nThese skills add structured workflows that prevent these issues. They don't replace Claude's capabilities - they guide them through the right sequence of steps.\n\nThere are no official Anthropic skills for Git/GitHub workflows. This plugin fills that gap.",

They serve different purposes and can be used together.\n\n| Feature | This skill | Official skill-creator |\n|---------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Complete frontmatter reference (10 fields) | Yes | No (only 5 fields) |\n| Invocation control matrix | Yes | No |\n| Dynamic context injection (`` !`cmd` ``) | Yes, with examples | No |\n| String substitutions (`$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`) | Yes | No |\n| Subagent execution (`context: fork`) | Yes, with example | No |\n| Discovery hierarchy | Yes | No |\n| Context budget (2%, 16k fallback) | Yes | No |\n| Skills/commands unification | Yes | No |\n| Frontmatter validation rules | Yes | No |\n| 6 feature-specific examples | Yes | No |\n| Scaffolding script (`init_skill.py`) | No | Yes |\n| Packaging script (`package_skill.py`) | No | Yes |\n| Validation script (`quick_validate.py`) | No | Yes |\n| Workflow patterns reference | No | Yes |\n| Output patterns reference | No | Yes |\n\n**In short**: this skill is a practical, up-to-date reference for all available features. The official skill is a conceptual guide with scaffolding/packaging tools. Install both for the most complete experience.",
