Translate a book\n\nIn Claude Code, say:\n\n```\ntranslate /path/to/book.pdf to Chinese\n```\n\nOr use the slash command:\n\n```\n/translate-book translate /path/to/book.pdf to Japanese\n```\n\nThe skill handles the full pipeline automatically — convert, chunk, translate in parallel, validate, merge, and build all output formats.\n\n### 3.

        "guidance": '### Step 1: Convert\n\n```bash\npython3 scripts/convert.py /path/to/book.pdf --olang zh\n```\n\nCalibre converts the input to HTMLZ, which is extracted and converted to Markdown, then split into chunks (~6000 chars each). A `manifest.json` records the SHA-256 hash of each source chunk for later validation.\n\n### Step 1.5: Glossary (term consistency across chunks)\n\nEach chunk is translated by a fresh-context sub-agent, which means the same proper noun can drift across multiple translations on a 100-chunk book. To fix this, the skill builds a glossary before translation:\n\n1. Sample 5 chunks (first, last, 3 evenly-spaced middle).\n2. Extract proper nouns and recurring domain terms; pick canonical translations.\n3. Write `<temp_dir>/glossary.json` (hand-editable schema below).\n4. Run `python3 scripts/glossary.py count-frequencies <temp_dir>` to populate per-term frequencies (ASCII terms use word-boundary regex so `cat` doesn\'t match `category`; CJK terms use substring; single-CJK-char terms are rejected; aliases count toward the term they belong to).\n5. For each chunk, the orchestrator calls `python3 scripts/glossary.py print-terms-for-chunk <temp_dir> chunkNNNN.md` and injects the resulting 3-column (`原文 | 别名 | 译文`) markdown table into that chunk\'s prompt as a hard constraint. Term selection = (terms whose source OR any alias appears in this chunk) ∪ (top-N most-frequent book-wide).\n\n```json\n{\n  "version": 2,\n  "terms": [\n    {"id": "Manhattan", "source": "Manhattan", "target": "曼哈顿",\n     "category": "place", "aliases": [], "gender": "unknown",\n     "confidence": "medium", "frequency": 12,\n     "evidence_refs": [], "notes": ""}\n  ],\n  "high_frequency_top_n": 20,\n  "applied_meta_hashes": {}\n}\n```\n\nExisting v1 `glossary.json` files are auto-upgraded to v2 on first load. v2 forbids the same surface form (source or alias) appearing in two different terms; if a v1 file has polysemous duplicate sources, the upgrade aborts with a disambiguation message — fix the file by hand and reload.\n\nEdit `glossary.json` between runs to fix translations; existing `glossary.json` is never overwritten — delete it to rebuild from scratch.\n\n> **Note on partial reruns**: in the current release, editing `glossary.json` after some chunks have been translated does NOT auto-invalidate those chunks — they keep their old translations. Precise glossary-driven re-translation is planned for the next commit. For now, delete the affected `output_chunk*.md` files (or the whole temp dir) to apply glossary edits.\n\n### Step 2: Translate (parallel subagents)\n\nThe skill launches subagents in batches (default: 8 concurrent). Each subagent:\n\n1. Reads one source chunk (e.g. `chunk0042.md`)\n2. Translates to the target language\n3. Writes the result to `output_chunk0042.md`\n\nIf a run is interrupted, re-running skips chunks that already have valid output files. Failed chunks are retried once automatically.\n\n### Step 3: Merge & Build\n\n```bash\npython3 scripts/merge_and_build.py --temp-dir book_temp --title "《translated title》"\n```\n\nBefore merging, the script validates:\n- Every source chunk has a corresponding output file (1:1 match)\n- Source chunk hashes match the manifest (no stale outputs)\n- No output files are empty\n\nThen: merge → Pandoc HTML → inject TOC → Calibre generates DOCX, EPUB, PDF.\n\n**Note:** `{book_name}_temp/` is a working directory for a single translation run. If you change the title, author, output language, template, or image assets, either use a fresh temp directory or delete the existing final artifacts (`output.md`, `book*.html`, `book.docx`, `book.epub`, `book.pdf`) before re-running.',

        "description": 'Tracking [issue #7](https://github.',
        "guidance": 'Tracking [issue #7](https://github.com/deusyu/translate-book/issues/7) — name/term inconsistency and pronoun/gender errors across chunks. Today\'s glossary covers high-frequency main entities; secondary characters, spelling variants, and pronoun resolution are not yet addressed. The plan is four independently shippable phases.\n\n### Design principles\n\n- **Scripts do bookkeeping; LLMs do semantic merge.** State, schemas, dedup, hashing, IO are deterministic Python. Naming, gender attribution, alias judgment, conflict resolution are LLM calls.\n- **Single writer for shared state.** Only the main agent writes `glossary.json` and `run_state.json`; sub-agents write per-chunk meta files. No locking needed.\n- **Conservative merge.** New entities require evidence; alias merges need LLM judgment, not just string similarity; gender starts at `unknown` and only moves up under explicit evidence; canonical values aren\'t silently overwritten on conflict.\n- **Three-layer state, three separate files.** `glossary.json` (canonical, sub-agents read), `output_chunkNNNN.meta.json` (raw per-chunk observations), `run_state.json` (orchestration).\n\n### Phase 1 — Sub-agent feedback + glossary merge (shipped)\n\nCloses the read+write loop. Glossary v2 adds `id`, `aliases`, `gender`, `confidence`, `evidence_refs`, `notes` (v1 files auto-upgrade on first load; the term table is now 3-col and aliases participate in selection). Sub-agents emit `output_chunkNNNN.meta.json` alongside each translated chunk. `scripts/merge_meta.py` (`prepare-merge` / `apply-merge` / `status`) merges per-batch with conservative rules: surface-form uniqueness enforced, malformed metas quarantined (warn + skip + count), confidence escalation via both `evidence_chunks` and `used_term_sources`, FIFO-cap at 5. See SKILL.md Step 4 / Step 4.5 / Step 5.\n\n### Phase 2 — Neighbor context for pronouns (not started, independent of Phase 1)\n\nInject `prev_excerpt` (last ~300 chars of previous chunk) and `next_excerpt` (first ~300 chars of next chunk) into each sub-agent prompt as read-only context. No new state files. Pure prompt-assembly change.\n\n### Phase 3 — Selective re-translation (not started, depends on Phase 1)\n\nPhase 1\'s batch feedback only improves *forward*. Selective rerun closes the *backward* loop: new `scripts/run_state.py` + `run_state.json` schema; per-chunk tracking of `glossary_version_used`, `entity_ids_used`, `output_hash`; five decision rules for deciding which chunks need re-translation this run.\n\n### Phase 4 — Bootstrap warm-up (experimental, gated on Phase 1 data)\n\nPhase 1 grows the glossary batch-by-batch, so the first batch sees the smallest glossary and has the highest drift risk. Possible approaches: sequential bootstrap, variable concurrency, or skip entirely. Decision belongs to whoever has run the system on real books.\n\n> The specific schemas and file layouts in each phase are illustrative — they may shift as Phase 1 hits real data. Phase 4 is gated on data; Phase 3 may be re-scoped or dropped if Phase 1 alone proves "good enough".\n\n### Parallel track — Pipeline / UX backlog (not started, separate from issue #7)\n\nRecent PR discussions also surfaced several useful workflow improvements, but these are broader than one-off patches and touch repo contracts (artifact names, temp-dir behavior, cleanup semantics, or EPUB compatibility scope). These are being tracked as maintainer-owned roadmap items rather than merged directly from the current PRs:\n\n- **Explicit EPUB cover support.** Add `--cover <image>` and pass it through the HTML -> EPUB Calibre step. Keep `--cover-from <epub>` / EPUB cover auto-extraction out of scope until the project is ready to own EPUB parsing compatibility across different package layouts. (context: closed #3)\n- **Configurable temp workspace location.** Keep the current cwd-local `{book_name}_temp/` default for compatibility. If this is revisited later, prefer an explicit `--temp-root` / `--work-dir` style option rather than silently changing the default location. (context: closed #4)\n- **Safer Calibre/Pandoc artifact cleanup.** Continue improving cleanup rules incrementally under regression tests, while preserving the current page-number detection semantics and not stripping real display-math delimiters or content numbers. (context: closed #5)\n- **Optional user-facing export names.** Keep canonical pipeline artifacts as `book.html`, `book_doc.html`, `book.docx`, `book.epub`, and `book.pdf`. If title-based filenames are added later, they should likely be optional exported aliases/copies rather than a silent replacement of the internal artifact contract. (context: closed #6)',
