The MCP server is more feature-rich with persistent sessions and works with multiple tools (Codex, Cursor, etc.).\n\n**Can I use both this skill and the MCP server?**\nYes! They serve different purposes. Use the skill for quick Claude Code integration, use the MCP server for persistent sessions and multi-tool support.\n\n**What if Chrome crashes?**\nRun: `"Clear NotebookLM browser data"` and try again.\n\n**Is my Google account secure?**\nChrome runs locally on your machine.

        "guidance": "This tool automates browser interactions with NotebookLM to make your workflow more efficient. However, a few friendly reminders:\n\n**About browser automation:**\nWhile I've built in humanization features (realistic typing speeds, natural delays, mouse movements) to make the automation behave more naturally, I can't guarantee Google won't detect or flag automated usage. I recommend using a dedicated Google account for automation rather than your primary account—think of it like web scraping: probably fine, but better safe than sorry!\n\n**About CLI tools and AI agents:**\nCLI tools like Claude Code, Codex, and similar AI-powered assistants are incredibly powerful, but they can make mistakes. Please use them with care and awareness:\n- Always review changes before committing or deploying\n- Test in safe environments first\n- Keep backups of important work\n- Remember: AI agents are assistants, not infallible oracles\n\nI built this tool for myself because I was tired of the copy-paste dance between NotebookLM and my editor. I'm sharing it in the hope it helps others too, but I can't take responsibility for any issues, data loss, or account problems that might occur. Use at your own discretion and judgment.\n\nThat said, if you run into problems or have questions, feel free to open an issue on GitHub. I'm happy to help troubleshoot!\n\n---",
